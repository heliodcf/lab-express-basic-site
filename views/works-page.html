            At age nine, Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, where he performed with his school group at the 2006 Richmond Dance Festival. There, he was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page, an associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot the Musical. Page arranged an audition for Holland, where the musical's director Stephen Daldry thought that he "had great potential and was a very natural actor".[17] After two years of training in ballet, tap dancing and acrobatics,[9] Holland won the role of Michael Caffrey, the protagonist's best friend, and made his debut performance at the West End's Victoria Palace Theatre in June 2008.[18] During his time performing in the musical, Holland learned gymnastics.[19] Holland says when his peers at school found out about his dancing activities, they started bullying him.[13]
            
            Later in 2008, Holland and co-star Tanner Pflueger were promoted to the lead role in the musical.[20] On his first day playing Elliot, Holland developed tonsillitis, but performed on stage anyway to positive reviews, but went to the doctor the next day.[1] Following his stage success, Holland hoped to be popular in school and that his schoolmates would stop bullying him. After being in a professional environment, however, he matured earlier than his peers and struggled to fit in. As a result, his General Certificate of Secondary Education grades suffered.[13] After his work on Billy Elliot the Musical finished in 2010,[21] Holland voiced a role in the British dub of the Japanese animated fantasy film Arrietty (2011),[22] and sent an audition tape to J.A. Bayona for a part in The Impossible (2012). Bayona then arranged a meeting, and had Holland write a letter to his mother and recite it as an audition. Impressed with his emotional delivery, Bayona cast Holland in the film.[23]
            
            In The Impossible, Holland played a teenager trapped with his family in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Transitioning from stage to screen was initially hard for Holland due to the shift from live audience to camera.[24] He and co-star Naomi Watts filmed scenes in a 35,000-gallon water tank, which were physically and psychologically taxing for them.[25] Working with Watts made Holland realise that he wanted to pursue an acting career permanently.[26] The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September to critical and commercial success,[27] earning $180.3 million against a budget of $45 million.[28] Holland received critical praise for his performance.[24] A. O. Scott of The New York Times found Holland to be "a terrific young actor", praising his character's transition from a self-involved to a responsible adolescent.[29] He won several awards, including the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance and London Film Critics Circle Award for Young British Performer of the Year.[30][31] Holland featured in the drama film How I Live Now (2013),[32] lent his voice in a supporting role for the drama film Locke (2013),[33] and had a cameo in Billy Elliot the Musical Live (2014).[34]</p>
